Example 8-4-1 in the Bishop et al text

Solve the non-linear programming programming problem

Max Z = X1 (5 - (X1)^2) + X2 (14 - 6 X2)
s.t.
        X1 + 4 X2 <= 18
        6 X1 + 2 X2 <= 26
        (X2)^2 <= 5

Where X1 and X2 are the two decision variables and limited to the range 0 and 3

NEW GAMS TERMS
** = Exponential operator: 3**2 = 3^2
NLP = Nonlinear program: SOLVE MODELX USING NLP MAXIMIZING Z
X("i2") = i2-th element of set i
X.LO = Lower limit for variable X: X.LO = 1;  (set lower limit to 1.0)
X.UP = Upper limit for variable X: X.UP = 3;  (set lower limit to 3.0)
X.L = Level for variable X: X.L = 2.5; (set level to 2.5. When this statement appears before
                         SOLVE statement, this sets the variable initial value).
